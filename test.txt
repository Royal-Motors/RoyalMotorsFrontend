To implement this in React, you can use React Router, which is a popular routing library for React. Here's an example of how you can use it to achieve your goal:


Import the necessary components from React Router in your app.js file:
javascript

import { BrowserRouter as Router, Switch, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';

Wrap your app component with the Router component:

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      {/* your app code here */}
    </Router>
  );
}

Create a new component that will display the details of a specific car:

function CarDetails(props) {
  const carId = props.match.params.id; // get the car id from the URL
  // get the car details from your data source
  const carDetails = getCarDetails(carId);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{carDetails.name}</h1>
      <p>{carDetails.description}</p>
      {/* display other details here */}
    </div>
  );
}

Create a new route for the CarDetails component in your app:

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Switch>
        <Route exact path="/">
          {/* your home page code here */}
        </Route>
        <Route path="/car/:id" component={CarDetails} />
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  );
}

Update your car selection component to use Link components to navigate to the CarDetails component:

function CarSelection() {
  const cars = getCars(); // get the list of cars from your data source

  return (
    <div>
      {cars.map((car) => (
        <Link to={`/car/${car.id}`}>
          <img src={car.imageUrl} alt={car.name} />
          <p>{car.name}</p>
        </Link>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
In the above code, we're using the Link component from React Router to create links to the CarDetails component for each car. We're passing the car id as a parameter in the URL using the /:id syntax. When the user clicks on a car, they'll be taken to the CarDetails component, where we'll use the match.params.id property to get the car id from the URL and display the details of that car.
